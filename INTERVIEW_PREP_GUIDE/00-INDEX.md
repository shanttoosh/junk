## üí° Interview Tips

### When Explaining Concepts

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Start with definition and intuition
- Explain "why" it matters (business relevance)
- Use examples and diagrams
- Discuss trade-offs

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Jump straight to equations
- Skip the "why" (motivation)
- Ignore limitations
- Forget business context

### When Explaining Projects

‚úÖ **Structure**:
1. **Problem**: What business problem did you solve?
2. **Approach**: Why this technical approach?
3. **Challenges**: What obstacles did you face?
4. **Solution**: How did you solve them?
5. **Impact**: What was the business result?

### Key Principles

1. **Always tie to business value**
2. **Show you understand trade-offs**
3. **Demonstrate systems thinking**
4. **Be prepared for "why" questions**
5. **Use diagrams when appropriate**

- Explain algorithms from first principles
- Discuss assumptions and when they're valid
- Compare different approaches
- Trade-offs in technical decisions

### System Design
- Architecture and scalability
- Data flow and processing
- Storage and retrieval strategies
- Performance considerations

### Business Acumen
- Problem identification and stakeholder value
- ROI and impact metrics
- Cost considerations and optimization
- Competitive advantages

## üìä Quick Reference

### Must-Know Formulas (Conceptual Understanding)

**Linear Regression**:
- Cost function: $J(\mathbf{w}) = \frac{1}{m}\sum(y - \hat{y})^2$
- Normal equation: $\mathbf{w} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}$

**Logistic Regression**:
- Sigmoid: $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$
- Decision boundary: $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b = 0$

**Decision Trees**:
- Gini: $1 - \sum p_i^2$
- Information Gain: $\text{Entropy(parent)} - \sum\frac{N_j}{N}\text{Entropy(child)}$

**PCA**:
- Covariance: $\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{m}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}$
- Eigenvectors are principal components

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Start here**: [Feature Engineering](01-ML-CONCEPTS/01-FEATURE-ENGINEERING.md)

Master the ML concepts first, then move to projects. This gives you the foundation to explain your technical decisions with confidence.

**Good luck! üéâ**
