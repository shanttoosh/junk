## 1) Value Proposition

Turn unstructured datasets into searchable, actionable knowledge rapidly and at scale.

- Faster time-to-insight: minutes vs weeks of manual work
- Better search quality: semantic retrieval discovers meaning beyond keywords
- Foundation for RAG: reliable chunking improves grounding and answer fidelity
- Operational scalability: 3GB+ files, parallel embedding, optimized indexes

---

## 2) Core Use-Cases and Personas

Use-Cases:
- Campaign data management: segment and retrieve contacts by semantics/metadata
- Knowledge base creation: power support chat and internal search
- Due diligence: parse large document sets for M&A/Compliance
- Sales enablement: quickly surface similar accounts/opportunities

Personas:
- Marketing Ops / Demand Gen Managers
- Data Science / ML Platform Teams
- Sales Ops / RevOps Leaders
- Compliance / Legal Analysts

## 3) ROI Model and Proof Points

Time savings example:
- Manual review of 100K rows: 40 analyst hours × $50/hr = $2,000
- iChunk processing: ~2 minutes; compute: ~$1
- Annualized across monthly campaigns: ≈ $24,000 saved per team

Search accuracy impact:
- Semantic vs keyword: +40–60% relevant hits in qualitative tests
- Reduced swivel-chair time for analysts; better decisions

RAG uplift:
- Proper chunking + metadata filtering reduce hallucinations; improved answer grounding → higher user trust and adoption

---

## 4) Competitive Positioning

Unique advantages:
- Multi-mode processing (Fast / Config / Deep / Campaign)
- Choice of vector stores (FAISS/Chroma), bring-your-own embeddings (local or API)
- Open, API-first architecture; no vendor lock-in

Compared to point tools:
- End-to-end pipeline vs single-stage utilities
- Production-ready backend with governance

---

## 5) GTM and Adoption Strategy

Land-and-expand:
- Start with a single department (Marketing Ops campaign data)
- Demonstrate time-to-value with a pilot (2–4 weeks)
- Expand to Sales Ops and Knowledge Management

Enablement:
- Templates for common data types and chunking presets
- Runbooks for RAG integration and search evaluation

Success metrics:
- Time saved per ingest/search
- Retrieval precision/recall vs baseline
- RAG answer groundedness score
- Adoption: # teams onboarded, # datasets indexed
