## 1) Impact Model and ROI

Assumptions (illustrative — adjust to your org):
- Customer LTV = $1,000
- Current churn rate = 26.58%
- Addressable base per cycle = 100,000
- Retention intervention cost per contacted customer = $15

Scenario:
- Target Top-10% highest risk (10,000 customers)
- Expected true churners in targeted cohort (precision 0.6): 6,000
- Save rate among targeted true churners: 30% → 1,800 customers saved
- Value preserved: 1,800 × $1,000 = $1.8M
- Campaign cost: 10,000 × $15 = $150K
- Net benefit ≈ $1.65M per cycle

Sensitivity: Vary precision, save rate, and LTV to stress test ROI; the model remains robust under wide ranges.

## 2) KPI Framework

Model KPIs:
- PR-AUC, Recall@Top-K (operational), Calibration error (Brier)
- Stability across time (month-over-month)

Business KPIs:
- Net saves (prevented churns)
- Net revenue preserved (saves × LTV − offer cost)
- Offer acceptance rate by risk tier
- Contact-to-save conversion rate
- Cost per retained customer

Operational KPIs:
- Outreach capacity utilization
- SLA adherence (contact high-risk within X days)

---

## 3) Retention Playbooks

Tiered actions by risk and value:
- High risk, high value: priority outreach, personalized retention bundle
- High risk, low value: digital offers (low-cost incentives)
- Medium risk: product education, proactive support
- Low risk, high value: loyalty rewards, upsell/cross-sell

Offer optimization:
- Multivariate tests on discount, messaging, channel
- Use uplift modeling to target customers most likely to be influenced

---

## 4) A/B Testing and Uplift Measurement

Design:
- Randomly split targeted cohort into control and treatment within each tier
- Treatment receives retention intervention; control receives standard care

Measure:
- Incremental saves = churn(control) − churn(treatment)
- Net lift in revenue preserved
- Optimize threshold and offer based on uplift and ROI

Avoid pitfalls:
- Contamination across groups; consistent measurement window
- Regression to the mean; use proper control

## 5) Roadmap and Risk Management

Roadmap:
- Phase 1: Baseline model + Top-10% targeting; establish KPI baselines
- Phase 2: Calibration, tiered playbooks, A/B testing
- Phase 3: Uplift modeling and offer optimization; real-time triggers
- Phase 4: Closed-loop learning with campaign outcomes

Risks & mitigations:
- Data drift → monitor PSI; retrain quarterly
- Offer fatigue → cap frequency; rotate creatives
- Fairness → audit feature/segment impacts; enforce policy rules
- Over-targeting low value → combine risk with CLV to prioritize
