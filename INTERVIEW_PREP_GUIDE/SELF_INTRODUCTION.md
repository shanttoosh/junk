# Self Introduction for Interview

## Complete Project Analysis Summary

### Churn Prediction Project (churn.ipynb)
**What the Project Does**:
Predicts which telecom customers are likely to churn by analyzing customer behavior patterns, service usage, and billing data. Helps marketing teams proactively intervene with retention offers before customers leave.

**Your Contributions**:
- Complete end-to-end ML pipeline development
- Data preprocessing: handled TotalCharges type conversion, null values
- Feature engineering: created categorical and numerical features  
- Class imbalance handling: implemented SMOTENC
- Model comparison: Tested 7 algorithms (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Evaluation: Cross-validation, ROC-AUC, accuracy metrics
- Visualization: Created interactive plots with Plotly

### iChunk Optimizer Project
**What the Project Does**:
An intelligent document processing and vector search system that transforms large unstructured datasets (CSVs, database exports) into searchable knowledge bases. Enables semantic search over company data - instead of keyword matching, it understands meaning. For example, searching for "healthcare companies" finds medical, hospital, clinic entries even if they don't contain exact word "healthcare".

**System Capabilities**:
- Processes files up to 3GB with intelligent chunking strategies
- Generates semantic embeddings for each chunk
- Creates vector databases (FAISS/ChromaDB) for fast retrieval
- Serves as foundation for RAG systems - enabling AI chatbots to answer from company knowledge

**Your Contributions** (~80%):
- Coordinated overall system architecture across backend, API, and frontend
- Implemented chunking strategies in backend processing engine
- Developed API endpoints for file processing modes
- Participated in frontend UI development (Streamlit and React)
- Integrated vector databases for semantic search functionality
- Handled large file processing optimizations (3GB+ files)

### Suggested AI Enhancements (What You Could Add):
1. **Reranking Module**: Implement cross-encoder models to reorder search results for higher precision
2. **Query Expansion**: Use LLM to generate semantic variants of user queries
3. **Embedding Cache**: Redis-based caching for repeated query embeddings
4. **Chunk Quality Validation**: LLM-based validation of chunk coherence and completeness
5. **Performance Analytics**: Dashboard to track search quality metrics over time
6. **Adaptive Chunking**: ML-based chunk size optimization based on content density analysis
7. **Active Learning**: Identify which chunks need manual labeling to improve the system

## Script (60-90 seconds)

Good morning/afternoon.

My name is **Shanttoosh V**, a Computer Science graduate from Meenakshi College of Engineering, Chennai. My passion into AI and machine learning started when I discovered how data-driven solutions can solve complex business challenges. 

I've completed two internships in AI/ML. At Velozity Global Solutions, I worked on ECG signal processing, developing noise filtering and segmentation techniques for cardiac data analysis. At Learnnex, I implemented customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on retail transaction data, identifying five distinct customer groups based on RFM metrics - recency, frequency, and monetary value.

Currently, I'm interning at **iOpex Technologies**, where I've been learning the fundamentals and advanced concepts of machine learning, including feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, supervised learning algorithms and ensemble methods

I'm working on two projects here. The first is a **Customer Churn Prediction System** for telecom. This system analyzes customer behavior patterns, service usage, and billing data to identify which customers are at risk of leaving, enabling marketing teams to proactively offer retention campaigns. I handled the end-to-end ML pipeline - preprocessing customer records with features including demographics, service usage, and billing information. I engineered features from raw data, implemented SMOTENC to handle the class imbalance, and compared seven different algorithms including gradient boosting models like XGBoost, LightGBM. My key focus was optimizing both precision and recall - ensuring we accurately identify true churners without wasting marketing budget on customers who would have stayed anyway. This balance is crucial to maximize ROI on retention campaigns.

The second project is the **iChunk Optimizer** - an intelligent document processing and vector search system that transforms large unstructured datasets into searchable knowledge bases. Instead of traditional keyword search, it enables semantic search that understands meaning - so searching for "healthcare companies" finds medical, hospital, clinic entries even if they don't contain the exact word "healthcare". The system processes files with intelligent chunking strategies, generates semantic embeddings, and creates vector indexes for fast retrieval, forming the foundation for RAG applications. I coordinated the overall system architecture, implemented chunking strategies in the backend processing engine, developed FastAPI endpoints for different processing modes, and created an intuitive user interface in React that enables seamless file uploads, search functionality, and result visualization.

What excites me most is building production-ready AI systems that bridge the gap between complex ML algorithms and practical business value, while ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Thank you.

## AI-Related Enhancements You Could Add to iChunk

### Suggested Improvements (To Complete the 20%):

1. **Reranking Module** (High Priority):
   - Implement a cross-encoder model (e.g., sentence-transformers/ms-marco-MiniLM) to reorder initial search results
   - Improves retrieval precision by 15-20%
   - Adds sophisticated ML component to your project

2. **Query Expansion with LLM**:
   - Use GPT or local LLM to generate semantic query variants
   - Example: "healthcare companies" → "medical services", "clinical providers", "health services"
   - Increases recall without adding noise

3. **Chunk Quality Validation**:
   - Add LLM-based validation to check if chunks are complete and coherent
   - Score each chunk and flag low-quality ones for re-chunking
   - Demonstrates quality-focused ML thinking

4. **Embedding Cache with Redis**:
   - Cache query embeddings for repeated searches
   - Reduces API calls and improves latency
   - Shows production optimization awareness

5. **Search Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Track which queries are popular, which return no results, average retrieval quality
   - Use data to continuously improve chunking strategies
   - Demonstrates data-driven product improvement

6. **Adaptive Chunking** (Advanced):
   - ML model to predict optimal chunk size based on content characteristics
   - Analyze content density and adjust chunking strategy automatically
   - Shows advanced ML integration

### Why These Make Sense:

- **ML-Oriented**: Each is a clear ML/AI component
- **Practical**: Directly improves system performance
- **Interview-Ready**: Shows breadth of AI knowledge
- **Achievable**: Can implement in remaining 20% of project

### What You Could Say:

*"To complete the project, I'm planning to add a reranking module that uses a cross-encoder to reorder search results by relevance, which should improve precision by about 15%. I'm also implementing LLM-based query expansion to generate semantic variants of user queries for better recall. These enhancements will leverage advanced ML techniques to further improve the system's intelligence."*
